# React Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This project utilized React to build a responsive portfolio page. There are four sections; about (a little about me), portfolio (some of my works), contact (responive form utilizing react-hook-form), and a resume page. 

This project helped me understand the basics of how to use react.

## Installation

To install my portfolio, the user will need to create a clone of this repository by using the command `git clone` in git bash. The user will then have to open this repository in VSCode. The user will have to have node installed in their vscode.  

[For more information on installing npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-install)


Once cloned open the repo into the user's VSCODE suite and open the integrated terminal.

Once the terminal is open run the following command `npm i` to install the necessary dependancies.

## Available-Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn-More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

I used [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to help create the responsive form.
